# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. A URL will be used for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last sven days, before adding it to a map for visualization. 

JavaScript and D3.js library will be used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Leaflet is used to plot the data on Mapbox map through an API request.
